# Computational-Physics
Course projects completed for the computational physics class (with Fortran code and reports).

1) Solving the Schrodinger equiation with a 2D potential and looking for the first 4 lowest-energy states. 
   
   Here we apply two methods: the Variational method and Lanczos method.
   Code: 2DSchrodingerEquation_VariationMethod.f90, 2DSchrodingerEquation_LanczosMethod.f90. 
   
2) Test a 64-bit Random Number generator.
   
   In this project, we test how random a random number generator is for each bit through the Random-Walk statistics.
   Code: 64-bitRandomGenerator.f90

3) Simulating a 2D Diluted Ising model.
   
   In this project, we apply Monte Carlo algorithm to study the properties of 2D Diluted Ising Model. We calculate its critical     temperature for the phase transition, as well as measure the behavior of order parameter and energy.
   Code: DilutedIsingModel.f90

4) Using Monte Carlo to do integration problem.
   
   Here we use Monte Carlo method to solve a math problem: integration
   Code: IntegrationUsingMonteCarlo.f90
